C++ cmdline Procedural map generator used for the game Project Zomboid. Also creating a DX11 IMGUI based interface for debugging and testing purposes. Found that the Zomboid WorldEd editor is open source so the bin file generation is GPL and can be copied so making an open source mod that uses the Zomboid mapping system to bring true procedurally generated maps to Project Zomboid.
